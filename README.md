# Classroom Manager

The idea behind this app is that a user can log into to see information about their schedule and stay in contact with people from their classes or teacher. Teachers can use the app to send out e-mails to the students in their classes. I would eventually like to add a chat room feature similar to something like Slack in each class for the students to be able to discuss assignments or projects etc. I would also like to see a private message feature added for students to reach out to each other, perhaps even create their own group chats for projects.

## Additional Info

- At this stage, the app has been styled with Bootsrap, and utilizes bootstrap_forms for rails with a gem. To install gems just run bundle and if you are using poor Iraqi internet like myself, go get a coffee.

- No e-mail feature has been added at this time. I hope to be able to rectify that in the future. I am thinking that some changes in the user setup is probably in order. Devise is probably the best option for this.

- In the future I want to be able to add a chat feature for each lecture and the mass email option for the teacher. Probably a job for JS/JQuery.
