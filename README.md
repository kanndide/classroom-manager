# Classroom Manager

The idea behind this app is that a user can log into to see information about their schedule and stay in contact with people from their classes or teacher. Teachers can use the app to send out e-mails to the students in their classes. I would eventually like to add a chat room feature similar to something like Slack in each class for the students to be able to discuss assignments or projects etc. I would also like to see a private message feature added for students to reach out to each other, perhaps even create their own group chats for projects.
